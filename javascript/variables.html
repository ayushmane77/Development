        //1. how is variable declared in javascript?

        // A variable in javascript can be stored in three ways: var, let, const
        var name = "Ayush";
        // let name = "ayush"; // will not work because 'name' variable is already declared and assigned.
        // const name = "Aayush"; // wiil also not work.
        document.write(name + "<br>");

        let name2 = "ayush"; // anything can be stored in variable(in all var,let,const) like 
        // integer, strings, objects , functions, boolean values, arrays etc.
        document.write(name2 + "<br>");

        let num = 7;
        document.write(num + "<br>");

        Boolean = true;
        document.write(Boolean + "<br>")

        const pie = 3.14;
        document.writeln(pie + "<br>");

        var obj = {// variables are also  assigned to objects or even nested objects
            // or array of objects
            firstName : "Ayush",
            lastName : "Mane",
            age : 22
        }
        console.table(obj["firstName"],obj["lastName"],obj["age"]);

        // A variable can also be declared without (let,var,const), but it is a bad practice.

        mobileNo = "+91 90XXXXXXX";
        document.write(mobileNo + "<br>");

        // 2. what are the different naming convention for declaring a variable name?
        let email = "saket12@gmail.com";
        var Email = "example23@gmail.com";
        const _email = "tushar56@gmail.com";
        let $email = "promod90@gmail.com";

        // A variable name should start with aplhabets(lowerCase or UpperCase), underscore(_)
        // or with a dollar($).
        // It cannot start with numbers,or with other non-aplhabetic characters

        // let &password = "dof@g0!"; will result a compilation error

        // A number can be inserted after first character of variable like
        var password7 = "gss@4#";
        let p7ass = 302;
        

        var hero,named = "homelander"; // 'hero' is one variable which is declared but not initialized
        // whereras second variable 'named' is declared and also initialized.
        document.write(hero + "<br>");
        document.write(named + "<br>");

        // rest all other characters cannot even start with a variable name, or be added in
        // between the variable name, and also not in end of variable name.
        // eg: (!,@,#,%,^,&,*)

        // 3. what is the difference between var, let and const?
        // var: can be accesible outside the lexical scope
        // It can be re-declared and re-initialized
        // It is not recommended to use var in modern javascript because of block and 
        // functional level scope.
        // If the variable is declared after accessing the variable, the compiler defines at 'undefined'

        // let: cannot be accessed outside its lexical scope.
        // It cannot be re-declared inside the same block level or function.
        // It can be re-initialized (re-assigned diffrent value).
        // It is recommended to use let in modern js to avoid unexperienced behaviour.

        // const: cannot be accessed outside the lexical scope.
        // It cannot be re-declared inside the same block level or function.
        // It cannot be re-initialized.
        // It is recommended to use const to make final value which cannot be changed.

        // eg:
        if(true){
            var a = 10;
            let b = 20;
            const c = 30;
        }
        document.write(a + "<br>");
        document.write(b + "<br>");
        document.write(c + "<br>");
